  Marko Community
</h1>

## Meetings

Community meetings are held to provide updates, facilitate realtime discussions of proposals, and attend to other community matters. The meetings are livestreamed on the [Marko YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/marko-js) and notes from the meetings are recorded in the [`meeting-notes`](./meeting-notes) directory.

An issue [labeled `meeting`](https://github.com/marko-js/community/labels/meeting) will be created prior to each meeting. Please comment on the issue if you have something you'd like added to the agenda.

## Proposals

This is also the recommended place for proposing new additions or changes to the Marko framework or ecosystem. To make a [proposal](https://github.com/marko-js/community/labels/proposal), fork this repo and make a copy of [`proposals/0000-template.md`](./proposals/0000-template.md) naming it `0000-your-proposal-name.md` the proposal number will be renamed before merging. Fill out the template and submit a Pull Request to this repo to begin the discussion.

A proposal can be in one of 6 states:

- Discussion (no label) - the proposal is in the inital discussion phase
- Provisional ([`provisional`](https://github.com/marko-js/community/labels/provisional)) - the proposal has reached concensus around the core idea, but still requires discussion about certain details
- Accepted ([`accepted`](https://github.com/marko-js/community/labels/accepted)) - the proposal has been finalized and is awaiting implementation
- Implemented ([`implemented`](https://github.com/marko-js/community/labels/implemented)) - the proposal has been implemented
- Withdrawn ([`withdrawn`](https://github.com/marko-js/community/labels/withdrawn)) - the proposal has been withdrawn by the author, or due to inactivity/lack of interest
- Rejected ([`rejected`](https://github.com/marko-js/community/labels/rejected)) - the proposal has been rejected
