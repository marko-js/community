# Title Goes Here

## Intro

> A _short_ explanation of the proposal.

## Motivation

> Some example points of discussion:
> 
> - What specific problems are you facing right now that you're trying to address?
> - Are there any previous discussions? Link to them and summarize them (don't force your readers to read them though!).
> - What use cases does it support? 
> - What is the expected outcome?

## Guide-level explanation

> Explain the proposal as if it was already implemented and you are now teaching it to another Marko developer. That generally means:
> 
> - Explaining the feature largely in terms of examples.
> - What names and terminology work best for these concepts and why? Is it a continuation of existing Marko patterns, or a wholly new one?
> - Explaining how Marko developers should _think_ about the feature, and how it should impact the way they use Marko. It should explain the impact as concretely as possible.
> - If applicable, describe the differences between teaching this to existing Marko developers and new Marko developers.

> For implementation-oriented proposals, this section should focus on how contributors should think about the change, and give examples of its concrete impact. For policy proposals, this section should provide an example-driven introduction to the policy, and explain its impact in concrete terms.

> Would the acceptance of this proposal mean the Marko docs must be re-organized or altered?

## Reference-level explanation

> This is the technical portion of the proposal. Explain the design in sufficient detail that:
> 
> - Its interaction with other features/tools is clear.
> - It is reasonably clear how the feature would be implemented.
> - Corner cases are dissected by example.
> - The section should return to the examples given in the previous section, and explain more fully how the detailed proposal makes those examples work.

## Migration strategy

> Is this proposal backwards incompatible? Does this proposal replace an existing feature/pattern? If so, can we safely and automatically migrate existing apps/components to this proposal? How?

> If applicable, provide sample error messages, deprecation warnings, or migration guidance.

## Drawbacks

> Why should we *not* do this? Please consider the impact on teaching Marko,
on the integration of this feature with other existing and planned features,
on the impact of the API churn on existing apps, etc.

> There are tradeoffs to choosing any path, please attempt to identify them here.

## Alternatives

> What other designs have been considered? What is the impact of not doing this?

## Prior art
> Discuss prior art, both the good and the bad, in relation to this proposal. A few examples of what this can include are:
> 
> - For language, runtime, taglib, tools, and compiler proposals: Does this feature exist in other languages or frameworks and what experience have their community had?
> - For community proposals: Is this done by some other community and what were their experiences with it?
> - For other teams: What lessons can we learn from what other communities have done here?

> This section is intended to encourage you as an author to think about the lessons from other languages/frameworks/communities, provide readers of your proposal with a fuller picture. If there is no prior art, that is fine - your ideas are interesting to us whether they are brand new or if it is an adaptation from somewhere else.

## Unresolved questions

> Optional, but suggested for first drafts. What parts of the design are still TBD?
